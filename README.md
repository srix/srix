This is place for my passion projects. When am not building new products [Zifilink.com](https://www.zifilink.com) and filing patents (have 6 and yes am show off) I would like to enjoy some dopamine release by working on side projects. Weekends I have other plans :) . 

My current muse is [PyTamil](https://github.com/srix/pytamil).  It is a python library that can decompile, analyse literary tamil (works written 1000 years before). I have borrowed and repurposed compiler technologies to analyse a classical language.
